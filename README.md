MFFS is dependent on the following libraries and API:
* NOVA API
* Resonant Engine

#### Set Up
To set up development workspace, you will need:
* NOVA API
* Resonant Engine

In order to test the mod with Minecraft, you also need to include:
* Minecraft Forge
* NOVA Minecraft Wrapper

Make sure the version of NOVA Minecraft Wrapper is the same as the Minecraft version you are testing the mod on.

On IntelliJ, a simple way to set up a workspace for development would be to clone all the required repositories, and adding them as different modules. You will need to set up dependencies for modules such that this mod depends on Resonant Engine, and Resonant Engine will depend on NOVA Minecraft Wrapper and NOVA API. NOVA Minecraft Wrapper will depend on Minecraft Forge. Please also ensure that the dependencies are set to export mode.
