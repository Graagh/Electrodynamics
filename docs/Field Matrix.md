# Field Matrix
A Field Matrix is a block that allows to focusing and precise control of waves and beams.
The Field Matrix has 6 sides, each side providing 8 slots for Module Crystals. Module Crystals
can be placed into the Field Matrix by right clicking on the slot of the Field Matrix. The amount
of modules placed per slot may affect the field generated.

A Field Matrix is activated when a sufficient level of wave energy is beamed to the center
crystal of the Field Matrix. The field generated is instantaneous, and constant energy must
be supplied in order to maintain the field.

## Force Fields
Force fields can be generated by the Field Matrix by focusing electromagnetic waves into
the center of the Field Matrix.

## Materialization Fields
A materialization field materializes blocks in the field space, allowing automated construction.
An electric wave must be focused into the center of the Field Matrix.
