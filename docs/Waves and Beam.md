# Waves and Beams

Beams in EDX arise from manipulating electromagnetic waves.
There are 3 different types of beams in EDX: Electromagnetic, Electric and Magnetic.
Each of these waves have a a beam strength, allowing them to carry energy.

## Electromagnetic Wave
The electromagnetic wave (laser beam) is capable of disintegrating blocks
when heated to high temperature.

In addition to disintegrating blocks, when aimed at a Field Matrix, it can
produce a force field. However, if the electromagnetic wave passes a certain
threshold, it will start disintegrating the blocks around it.

An electromagnetic wave can be split into an electric and magnetic wave through
a Diverging Crystal.

## Electric (Materializes)
The electric wave is capable of manipulating atoms and materializing objects.
It can be used as a tool to build structures.

When an electric wave is aimed at a Field Matrix, it will produce a field that
materializes blocks based on the Shape Crystal provided.

## Magnetic (Moves)
The magnetic wave is capable of moving objects by manipulating the magnetic field.
Magnetic waves can act as carriers or retractor beams to move items and entities around.

The magnetic and electric wave can be converted into an electromagnetic wave by
combining them in a Converging Crystal.
