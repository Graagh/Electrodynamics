# Module Crystal
A Module Crystal is a crystal that can be placed in the sockets of the Field Matrix. A Module Crystal changes specific properties of the field. Note that the side the Crystal is placed affects the properties of the field of the Module Crystal is direction dependent.
## Transformation Modules
Transformation Modules changes the shape of the field.
### Translation Crystal
The Translation Crystal changes the position of the field. Placing one Translation Crystal in one side of the Field Matrix moves the field by one block. Each Translation Crystal adds a high energy cost to the field.
### Scale Crystal
The Scale Crystal changes the size of the field. Placing a Scale Crystal in one side of a Field Matrix increases the size of the field in that direction by one block.
### Rotation Crystal
The Rotation Crystal rotates the field. Each Rotation Crystal placed in the Field Matrix rotates the field by 2 degrees around the axis which the Crystal is placed in. For example, placing 30 Rotation Crystals on the top face of the Field Matrix will rotate the field by 60 degrees around the y-axis.
