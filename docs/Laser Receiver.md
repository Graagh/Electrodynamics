# Laser Receiver
The Laser Receiver is capable of receiving electromagnetic (laser), electric or magnetic waves. The the Laser Receiver receives a wave, it will produce an electric current proportional to the energy of the wave incident on the receiver. Therefore, a strong laser beam aimed at the receiver will produce more energy.
The Laser Receiver allows lasers to be used as a method of transferring energy without physical material. However, lasers dissipate energy quickly and the energy loss is very high,
