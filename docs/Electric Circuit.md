# Electric Circuit
## Electric Wire
Electric wires are capable of transferring electrical energy. There exists several types of wires in EDX.
* Copper
* Tin
* Gold
* Iron
* Superconductor

# Battery
The battery is a block capable of storing electric energy. The battery is a component of a circuit and is capable of both receiving and producing energy.

### Minecraft
In Minecraft, the Battery can be set to recharge or discharge mode based on be Redstone signal. When Redstone signal is applied, the battery will produce a voltage across the circuit, powering components in it. When the battery is not powered by Redstone, it will act as a resistor and consume energy in the circuit, recharging itself.
Note that the energy inside a battery will slowly deplete as it is unreliable.

## Resistors
The resistor is capable of providing resistance in a circuit to dissipate energy. Resistors are sometimes required to prevent a circuit from overloading its components.
